# The Final Combination
The Final Combination [GFM SUBMODS]
that will bring TGC to the GFM, at least a few aspect of it, that include :
the sweet endonyms submods of the tgc to the gfm that will surely make your map more lively, with most(not all nation) having their own languange as there nation name!

the second thing is the TGC UI, yeah the ui used in tgc is carefully reproduced to be suitable and playable in gfm(i spend the entire afternoon for this) that will bring you a strange combination between GFM and TGC.

3, the last change is the TGC Darkwater map, originally created by the now dissapeared mxwell, the well known map creator in TGC community, he bring us a couple of new mapmods to tgc, but the darkwater map surely became our favorite(at least it's my favorite), i personally have exported or porting this map mods to couple of well known mods for example MHM, DOD, AOE, PA, i done all of this in early  to middle 2024 but never published it myself other than sending it to the correspondent discord server, other than the mod in VIC2, i also exported this particular mapmods or we can even call it recreate it as close as possible to the original one, to other paradox game that is CK2(crusader King 2), i even make a couple of version myself the darkwater one, the lightwater, and the brightwater that i never push to github myself only uploading it to their NEOW CK2 discord server, and finally i ported this beloved mapmods to other VIC2 Mods that is GFM.
thank you for reading this, and thank you for your attention, i hope this submods can be usefull for you guys!
