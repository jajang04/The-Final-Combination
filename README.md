# The Final Combination
The Final Combination [GFM SUBMODS]
This will bring TGC to the GFM, at least in a few aspects. It includes:

1. The sweet endonyms submods from TGC to GFM that will surely make your map more lively, with most (though not all) nations having their own language as their nation name!

2. The second feature is the TGC UI. Yes, the UI used in TGC has been carefully reproduced to fit and be playable in GFM (I spent the entire afternoon on this!). This will give you a unique combination between GFM and TGC.

3. The final change is the TGC Darkwater map, originally created by the now-missing Mxwell, a well-known map creator in the TGC community. He brought us several new map mods for TGC, but the Darkwater map definitely became a favorite (at least it’s my favorite). Personally, I’ve exported or ported this map mod to several well-known mods, such as MHM, DOD, AOE, and PA. I did this from early to mid-2024, but I never published it myself, other than sending it to the relevant Discord servers.

Apart from the VIC2 mod, I also exported this particular map mod (or even recreated it as closely as possible to the original) to other Paradox games, such as CK2 (Crusader Kings 2). I even made a few versions myself: Darkwater, Lightwater, and Brightwater, but never pushed them to GitHub. I only uploaded them to the NEOW CK2 Discord server. Finally, I ported this beloved map mod to another VIC2 mod, GFM.

Thank you for reading, and thank you for your attention. I hope these submods can be useful to you all!
